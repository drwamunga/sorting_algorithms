# sorting_algorithms
Big O notation and Sorting Algorithms The aim of this project is to learn at least four sorting algorithms. All the files are written in C and are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89. The code uses Betty style and it is checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl. All the prototype declarations are in the header file sort.h.  Tests. The sorting algorithms are tested with big sets of random integers with the help of Random.org
